Analysis of loan default risk.
The project involves preparing a report for the lending division of a bank. It should be found out whether a client's marital status and number of children have an impact on defaulting on a loan. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of clients.

The report will be taken into account when creating a credit score for a potential customer. The credit score is used to evaluate a potential borrower's ability to repay their loan.
